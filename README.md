# Automatic-Directory-Hasher
This hashing tool uses BLAKE-3 to monitor and hash files by chunks into hexidecimal values. To use this tool update the HASH_DIR value to the directory that you would like the program to watch over, and update the META_DIR value to select the directory you would like the program to store metadata for the files / hashing process.
